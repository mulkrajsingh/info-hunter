        "Inflammatory-driven processes are likely primary drivers of coagulopathy in COVID-19, but the exact mechanisms linking inflammation to dysregulated hemostasis and thrombosis are yet to be delineated.  The article discussed in detail a new hypothesis proposed by Chinese physicians about a new component in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, namely, about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the hemoglobin beta-chain and the formation of a complex with porphyrin, which results in displacement of the iron ion  . SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause direct vascular disease or enhance the immunogenic thrombosis environment through several mechanisms.  A pressing question is therefore if COVID-19 associated thrombosis could be caused by overactivation of the complement cascade?  . The mechanisms exerted by SARS-CoV-2 that impairs hemostatic balance include endothelial injury, inflammation, activation of the immune and complement systems.",
        "The role of three systems involved in the SARS- CoV-2 infection (renin-angiotensin, kinin and coagulation systems) is discussed with the objectives to identify and try to explain several of the events observed during the evolution of the disease and to suggest possible targets for therapeutic interventions. One hypothesis is that progressive endothelial damage from the virus leads to microvascular thrombosis.  However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection alters platelet function to contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains unknown.  In this study, we report altered platelet gene expression and functional responses in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.  These findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with platelet hyperreactivity, which may contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Overall, this work identifies the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that might be most detrimental in terms of endothelial dysfunction, thereby shedding light on vascular aspects of COVID-19.",

Dysfunctions of endothelial cells and platelets are tightly linked in contributing to the systemic inflammatory response that appears to be both a cause and a consequence of COVID-19-associated coagulation disorders and thrombotic events . Recent studies suggest contribution of fibrinolysis shutdown to this phenomenon . Endothelial injury and alteration of its antithrombotic activity can lead to micro- and macrovascular thrombosis in the lungs, occurrence of which is associated with poor clinical outcome in critically ill patients with COVID-19 . Additionally, the hypercoagulability induced by activation of coagulation pathways during the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to impaired organ perfusion . This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients . Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia",
        "In this review, the authors analyze possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the hemostasis disorders observed in the pathological progression of COVID-19, and also focus the attention of researchers on seaweed PSs as potential drugs aimed to correction these disorders in COVID-19 patients. This clinical review paper discusses the pathophysiology of the pulmonary and cardiovascular manifestations of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ensuing implications on acute cardiovascular care in patients presenting with a severe COVID-19 syndrome admitted to an intensive acute cardiac care unit. The high prevalence of old age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and ischaemic heart disease in patients who develop a severe to critical COVID-19 syndrome suggests shared pathophysiological mechanisms. BACKGROUND: A considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals could be asymptomatic and don���t need medical treatment. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic cases, medium-intensity forms with mild to moderate symptoms, to severe ones with bilateral pneumonia and respiratory distress. In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect hematopoiesis, hemostasis, coagulation, fibrinolysis, bone metabolism, thyroid, parathyroid glands, the liver, and the reproductive system.

Furthermore, increasing reports of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi suggest that hemostatic imbalances may contribute to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with oxidative stress that triggers cytokine production, inflammation, and other pathophysiological processes. In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death. The consequent imbalance in vasodilation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombotic response may contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Furthermore, increasing reports of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi suggest that hemostatic imbalances may contribute to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death. The consequent imbalance in vasodilation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombotic response may contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The common pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular events is represented by coagulation abnormalities and disruption of factors released by endothelial cells, which contribute in maintaining the blood vessels into an anti-thrombotic state."

Characteristics, outcome and predictors of in-hospital mortality in an elderly population from a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care facility . CONCLUSION: Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19 . Elderly population, due to various reasons such as low immunity, pre-existing co-morbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases or diabetes, are obviously predisposed to develop severe infections and exhibit a high mortality rate . The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response . Regression analyses support the hypotheses of positive correlations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and socioeconomic factors including population density, proportions of elderly residents, poverty, and percent population tested",
        "Pandemics tend to have higher occurrence (morbidity) in younger individuals but higher mortality for the elderly . Why the elderly appear to be more severely affected by COVID-19: The potential role of immunosenescence and CMV . Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age . CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated in this study show that COVID-19 infection and frailty were significantly associated with increased mortality in older patients . Our findings also show a higher level of awareness and concern among older respondents, in line with the evidence that the elderly are at highest risk of severe complications following infection from COVID-19 . CONCLUSION: High mortality rates are observed in older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a higher risk of dying in those with severe functional dependence or cognitive impairment . The key factors are that the mortality risk from a Covid-19 infection increases exponentially with age and that the sizes of age cohorts decrease linearly at the top of the population pyramid",
        "Advanced age is the most frequently reported factor associated to mortality . The aim of our study was to assess the factors related to mortality among COVID-19 patients and develop a prediction model based on these factors . Though the reasons for these robust associations are unclear, effects of age and sex on innate and adaptive lymphoid subsets, including on homeostatic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) implicated in disease tolerance, may underlie the effects of age and sex on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality . Clinical profile and predictors of in-hospital mortality among older patients admitted for COVID-19 . Age \u0026#8805;75 years, dementia, peripheral oxygen saturation \u003c92%, severe lymphopenia and qSOFA scale \u003e1 were independent predictors of mortality in this population . CONCLUSIONS: Old age (\u003e70 years), neutrophilia, C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase over 300 U/L are high-risk factors for mortality in critical patients with COVID-19",

Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality . CONCLUSION: Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19 . Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension .

        "Pandemics tend to have higher occurrence (morbidity) in younger individuals but higher mortality for the elderly. Elderly patients 65 years of age or older are known to have more severe systemic disease and higher rates of neurologic complications. Morbidity and mortality is very high in the elderly population with 6���930 times higher likelihood of death compared to younger cohorts, with the highest risk in elderly patients ���85 years and especially those with medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and underlying respiratory illness. Elderly patients with preexisting neurologic diseases are susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection and higher rates of mortality. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19. Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age.",

Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age. The parallels to the general age specific mortality rates do not imply that COVID-19 does not pose an additional risk. Based on the higher mortality, this study attempts to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 in elderly subjects with cardiovascular diseases as well as the cause of the high mortality result from COVID-19. Mortality from COVID-19 has been particularly high in elderly patients on mechanical ventilation. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality.",

Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age. The parallels to the general age specific mortality rates do not imply that COVID-19 does not pose an additional risk. Based on the higher mortality, this study attempts to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 in elderly subjects with cardiovascular diseases as well as the cause of the high mortality result from COVID-19. The institutionalized elderly individuals present health conditions that may contribute to the occurrence of adverse outcomes in case of infection by Covid-19.

Our results suggest that influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19. As such, the present work aims to identify risk factors for mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19. Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

BACKGROUND: A considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals could be asymptomatic and don���t need medical treatment. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic cases, medium-intensity forms with mild to moderate symptoms, to severe ones with bilateral pneumonia and respiratory distress. In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death. A similar mechanism has been reported in SARS���CoV���2 with the release of cytokines and chemokines by macrophages throughout the course of infection.",

Here, we review the mechanisms by which the peptidergic substrates and products of ACE and ACE2 contribute to physiological and pathophysiological processes and hypothesise how down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry disrupts homeostasis.

CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we reported autoptic evidences of thrombotic pulmonary arterial fatal lesions in an asymptomatic COVID-19 patient, after swab negativization. In the present review, we present current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie thrombotic complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we provide clinical data regarding the incidence rate of thrombotic events in several viral respiratory infections that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, including SARS-CoV-2 infection and finally we summarize current recommendations concerning thromboprophylaxis and antithrombotic therapy in patients with thrombotic complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The figure summarizes the steps of the thrombotic pathophysiological sequence that consecutively includes the aggression of the host cells by the SARS-CoV-2, the excessive immune response-induced cytokine storm, the local and systemic inflammatory response responsible for an endotheliopathy and a hypercoagulability state, leading to both systemic and macro- and micro-thrombosis. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms leading to severe pulmonary vascular dysfunction and ARDS have not been elucidated.

        "In this review, the authors analyze possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the hemostasis disorders observed in the pathological progression of COVID-19, and also focus the attention of researchers on seaweed PSs as potential drugs aimed to correction these disorders in COVID-19 patients. This clinical review paper discusses the pathophysiology of the pulmonary and cardiovascular manifestations of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ensuing implications on acute cardiovascular care in patients presenting with a severe COVID-19 syndrome admitted to an intensive acute cardiac care unit. In this paper we provide a review of the epidemiological characteristics and the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and formulate the hypothesis that endothelialitis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary and cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death. From nascent reports describing SARS-CoV-2, we make inferences on the basis of the parallel pathophysiological and immunological features of the other human coronaviruses targeting the lower respiratory tract ��� severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing major threat to global health and has posed significant challenges for the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients.",
        "In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with oxidative stress that triggers cytokine production, inflammation, and other pathophysiological processes. ��� Cytokine hyperactivation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 might be a possible mechanism.

In this paper we provide a review of the epidemiological characteristics and the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and formulate the hypothesis that endothelialitis may play a key role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary and cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing major threat to global health and has posed significant challenges for the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Here, we outline the pathophysiological processes through which cytokine storms contribute to the deterioration of SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system, as well as the pathophysiology of immune response dysfunction that leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and coagulation impairment.",

In the light of COVID���19 pandemic, VitD might be a promising agent for fighting the SARS���CoV���2, since VitD is involved in various pathophysiological mechanisms that occur during COVID���19 infection. Coagulation disorders, endotheliopathy and inflammation are the most common hallmarks in SARS-CoV-2 infection, largely determining COVID-19���s outcome and severity. Thus, AKI and proteinuria are independent risk factors for mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In a pathophysiological perspective, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by numerous dependent pathways triggered by hypercytokinemia, especially IL-6 and TNF-alpha, leading to systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and multiple organ dysfunction. In cases with severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the induction of hypercoagulability is one of the pathophysiological mechanism that can contribute to death. The consequent imbalance in vasodilation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombotic response may contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The common pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular events is represented by coagulation abnormalities and disruption of factors released by endothelial cells, which contribute in maintaining the blood vessels into an anti-thrombotic state. CONCLUSIONS The pathophysiology of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from other coronaviruses due to preferentially targeting olfactory supporting cells."

For those who recover, post-COVID-19 complications may include development of pulmonary fibrosis. Most patients recover from COVID-19 within a few weeks, but some patients have symptoms lasting for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cough. Neurological complications of COVID-19 have not been reported. A central clinical question as the world deals with the COVID-19 pandemic is what the long-term sequelae for the millions of individuals will be who recover from the hyperinflammatory state characterizing COVID-19 and in particular for the hundreds of thousands who are ill enough to need hospitalization and in particular ICU care."
